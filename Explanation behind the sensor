This is a simple sensor that works with the Olimex eduArdu board(copy of the original Arduino Leonardo board). It has a bunch of sensors, but we are mainly using the rgb sensor, the led matrix, the joystick, the buzzer,and the sonar. 
To provide more information about the sensor, its simple, you rotate the joystick and it changes the colour the rgb sensor is producing.
The sonar sends sound waves, that should be reflected by the material that's infront of it(please don't use smooth curved materials, as they can cause the waves to bounce in a different direction).
If the wave is in less than a meter distance from us, the buzzer will start ringing in a slow manner.
The closer we get the more intense the ringing will be. We change the ringing by altering the mHz that the buzzer uses.
More mHz the faster it will ring, the stronger it will sound, and the opposite will result in less ringing.
